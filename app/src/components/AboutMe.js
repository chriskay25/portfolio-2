        Hello! My name is Chris Kay and I'm a full stack software engineer from Atlanta, Georgia. As an intensely curious person, I've always been fascinated by technology. I'm interested in finding a position as a junior developer at a company where I can learn from more experienced engineers and improve and expand my skillset.
