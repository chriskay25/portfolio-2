      <p>
        I'm a full stack web developer from Atlanta, Georgia. Professionally, I've worked in sales and account management and gained valuable communication skills doing so, but I'm very excited to finally step into an analytical, technical role. I recently graduated from Flatiron School's software engineering program, where I learned full stack web development and computer science fundamentals.

        As a new developer, I'd like to find a position at a company where I can learn from more experienced engineers and improve and expand my skillset. Having lived in Atlanta for many years, it would be wonderful to find a position with an Atlanta organization. That being said, I'm open to remote work with any US companies that could use my skills.
